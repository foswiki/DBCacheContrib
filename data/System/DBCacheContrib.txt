Reusable code that caches Foswiki topics, and provides fast
searches of the content.

%TOC%

---++ Summary of Contents

This module supports fast structured queries over topics in an
arbitrarily-sized web. It uses a database to cache topic data to
deliver much more scaleable search performance. Different back-end
techologies can be used to implement the cache, to allow simple
tradeoffs between scaling and raw performance.

Historically this module was designed to be used with a
companion plugin, such as Foswiki:Extensions.FormQueryPlugin or
Foswiki:Extensions.DBCachePlugin, which support queries and the display of
query results. When used this way, the %TOPIC% supports queries made using
a simple [[%TOPIC%#QueryLanguage][query language]].

The module can also be used in "standard schema mode" to support plugins
that accelerate core functions, such as the !QueryAcceleratorPlugin.

---++ Features
   * Perform efficient structured queries on data in forms

---++ Using the built-in query language
The query language supported by !DBCacheContrib is very similar to the query language used with %SEARCH, which was derived from it. The contrib can be used in two modes; compatible schema mode (as used by !FormQueryPlugin and !DBCachePlugin) and standard schema mode (as described in QuerySearch).

In standard schema mode the schema of the DB is as described in QuerySearch.
In compatible schema mode, the underlying schema is somewhat different, to
support the extended requirements of the plugins that use it.

---+++ The Compatible Schema
You can think of the database as an map of all the topics in a web. Each
entry is itself a map (or hash, in perl terms) that maps a set of field
names to values.

Each topic in the web automatically gets a number of standard fields, generated
by reading the metadata from the topic (see %SYSTEMWEB%.MetaData)
   * =name=        - name of the topic
   * =parent=      - *name* of parent topic
   * =attachments= - array of maps, each of which contains:
      * =name= - attachment name
      * =attr= - e.g hidden
      * =comment= - attachment comment
      * =path= - client path used to upload attachment
      * =size= - size in Kb
      * =user= - who uploaded the attachment
      * =version= - e.g. 1.3
   * =info= - map containing:
      * =author= - most recent author
      * =date= - date of last change
      * =format= - topic format version
      * =version= - topic version number
   * =moved= - map containing:
      * =by= - who moved it
      * =date= - when they moved it
      * =from= - where they moved it from
      * =to= - where they moved it to
   * =preferences= - array of maps, each of which contains:
      * =name= - preference name
      * =type= - either Set or Local
      * =value= - the value of the named preference 
   * =form= - form type
   *  _form name_ - e.g. if a "My<nop>Form" is attached, this will be
          =My<nop>Form=. This is a reference to a map containing a key for each
          field in the form. Each key maps to the value in the form data for
          that key. 
   * =text= - raw text of the topic)

Other fields may be added by subclasses. Refer to the documentation for the
plugin that is using the DBCache for more details.

---++ Query operators
%STARTSECTION{"searchoperators"}%
Fields are given by name, and values by strings or numbers. Strings should always be surrounded by 'single-quotes'. Strings which are regular expressions (RHS of <nop>=, !<nop>= <nop>=~ operators) use 'perl' regular expression syntax (google for =perlre= for help). Numbers can be signed integers or decimals. Single quotes in values may be escaped using backslash (\).

The following operators are available:
| *Operator* | *Result* | *Meaning* |
| <code>=</code> | Boolean | LHS exactly matches the regular expression on the RHS. The expression must match the whole string. |
| <code>!=</code> | Boolean | Inverse of = |
| <code>=~</code> | Boolean | LHS contains RHS i.e. the RHS is found somewhere in the field value. |
| <code>&lt;</code> | Boolean | Numeric < |
| <code>&gt;</code> | Boolean | Numeric > |
| <code>&gt;=</code> | Boolean | Numeric >= |
| <code>&lt;=</code> | Boolean | Numeric <= |
| =@= | Node | Access node referenced by LHS. e.g. =ProjectLeader@TopicTitle= returns the formfield =TopicTitle= of the topic stored in the formfield =ProjectLeader=  |
| =lc= | String | Unary lower case |
| =uc= | String | Unary UPPER CASE |
| =d2n= | Number | Convert a date string into epoch seconds |
| =length= | Number | Length of an array, e.g. =length(attachments)= to return the number of attachments |
| <code>!</code> | Boolean | Unary NOT |
| =AND= | Boolean | AND |
| =OR= | Boolean | OR |
| =ALLOWS= | Boolean | LHS is a topic that allows to perform RHS by the current user e.g. =topic ALLOWS VIEW= is true when the current user is allowed to view the given topic |
| <code>()</code> | any | Bracketed subexpression |
| =IS_DATE= | Boolean | Compare two dates e.g. '1 Apr 2003' IS_DATE '1 Apr 2004' |
| =EARLIER_THAN= | Boolean | Date is earlier than the given date |
| =EARLIER_THAN_OR_ON= | Boolean | Date is earlier than, or on, the given date |
| =LATER_THAN= | Boolean | LHS is later than the given date |
| =LATER_THAN_OR_ON= | Boolean | LHS is later than the given date |
| =WITHIN_DAYS= | Boolean | Date (which must be in the future) is within n _working_ days of todays date |

%ENDSECTION{"searchoperators"}%

---++ Working with dates

!DBCacheContrib can parse dates during _indexing time_, that is when the topic is saved and further stored into its internal database format. Dates must be explicitly marked as being of such
a data type by means of a [[%SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms][DataForm definition]]. A date formfield is stored in epoch seconds as well as in a secondary attribute named =&lt;fieldName_origvalue&gt;=.
This lets you access the original value as it was edited by the user. 

As an effect, dates may be compared and sorted directly, i.e. without any further conversion during _search time_. Two dates can be compared directly against each other using numerical comparison
operators. This means that the operators =IS_DATE=, =EARLIER_THAN=, =EARLIERTHAN_OR_ON=, =LATER_THAN= and =LATER_THAN_OR_ON= can be replaced with ===, =&lt;=, =&lt;==, =&gt;= and =&gt;== respectively.

In the case that you have to specify date strings explicitly as part of the query, use =d2n(&lt;date-string)= to first convert it into an integer before comparing it against a date formfield.

=WITHIN_DAYS= works out the number of _working_ days assuming a 5 day week (i.e. excluding Saturday and Sunday). Apologies in advance if your weekend is offset &plusmn; a day! Integers will automatically be converted to dates, by assuming they represent a number of seconds since midnight GMT on 1st January 1970. You can also use the =d2n= operator to convert a date string to such an integer.

---++ Date formats

Dates must be dates in the format expected by =Time::ParseDate=. In addition the following formats are understood as well:

   * =yyyymmdd=
   * =dd.mm.yyyy=
   * =yyyymmddThhmmss=
   * =yyyymmddThhmmssZ&lt;offset>=

---++ The cache
To achieve best perfomance the plugin caches the data read from topics in a
database. The database is stored in the work area for the DBCacheContrib (see
={WorkAreaDir}= in =configure=). If any topic changes in the web, this
cache is automatically updated.

---++ Detailed Documentation
Clients use the DBCache by defining a subclass of the
=Foswiki::Contrib::DBCacheContrib= class. Implementors are stongly recommended to read the POD documentation in the code:
